                    It's a late Monday night, and I'm at one of UC Berkeley's campus libraries, studying with my friends for our upcoming midterm. After staying there for hours cramming through practice exams, we are exhausted and decide to call it a day. I begin packing my bags, but then have a sudden realization: it is 11PM, my friends live on the other side of campus, and my off-campus dorm is three blocks away.

                <subtitle data-sr="enter left move 50px wait 0.15s">
                    Well, three blocks can't be that bad of a walk, right?

                    Sure, the walk isn't too bad when walking in the middle of the day. But when you're a new student walking alone in the middle of the night and you're constantly emailed police reports of crime activity around campus (bearing in mind that <a class="hi-here" href="http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/18/female-student-robbed-at-uc-berkeleys-crossroads-dining-hall-on-tuesday/" target="_blank">some of these incidents</a> occur in <a class="hi-here" href="http://www.dailycal.org/2018/04/04/2-uc-berkeley-students-robbed-gunpoint-broad-daylight-3-suspects-arrested" target="_blank">broad daylight</a>), three blocks can feel like a treacherous journey.

                    That is the city of <a class="hi-here" href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/berkeley/crime" target="_blank">Berkeley's Crime Index Ranking,</a> meaning that Berkeley is only safer than 4% of all U.S. cities. Many UC Berkeley students have experiences similar to mine, regularly staying on campus until the evening to study or contribute to their extracurricular activities, putting themselves at risk when they choose to walk back home. And these safety concerns extend to cities around the world, affecting everyone from college student to full-time employee.
