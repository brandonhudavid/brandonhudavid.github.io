The app would have to scrape and visualize airspace restriction data published by the <a className=\"ford\">Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</a> The app would also have <a className=\"ford\">Ford Sync,</a> the ability to sync with Ford vehicles' screen interfaces.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        We set up weekly design meetings with Ford engineers in order to ensure that we were on the same page with what we envisioned for the app. The meetings were mainly discussions about ways to design and implement essential features. Since the app would have <a className=\"ford\"></a>Ford Sync functionality, we also inquired about creating designs for the car screen interface.\n                    </p>\n                </Bounce>\n\n                <Bounce left delay={200}>\n                    <subtitle>\n                        Color scheme.\n                    </subtitle>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        One of the first questions I asked the engineers was if Ford had a branding scheme that they would like us to comply with.

The map view also includes an adjustable flight radius around the user's current location, a search bar to search other locations, a hamburger button at the top left, a button at the top right to center the map view on the user's location, and a blue-accented button at the bottom right.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        Tapping on the hamburger button reveals a side panel that allows the user to see past flights, manage info about their aircrafts, and view a pre-flight checklist.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        When the blue-accented button is tapped, a bottom drawer pops up and lists any restricted zones within the flight radius.

We then decided on a color scheme with green (resembling carrot leaves), white (for the rabbit), and orange (for the carrot itself). We would later decide to only use the white and orange colors for the app.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"proj-collection\">\n                        <img data-sr=\"enter bottom move 50px wait 0.2s\" className=\"proj-img20 proj-shadow\" src={logo1}/>\n                        <img data-sr=\"enter bottom move 50px wait 0.25s\" className=\"proj-img20 proj-shadow\" src={colors}/>\n                        <img data-sr=\"enter bottom move 50px wait 0.3s\" className=\"proj-img20 proj-shadow\" src={logo2}/>\n                    </div>\n                </Bounce>\n                <Bounce left delay={200}>\n                    <subtitle>\n                        Low fidelity designs and wireframes.\n                    </subtitle>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        For the app's workflow, we wanted the initial page to display all of the user's current habbits, making it easy for users to view and select habbits they have performed. From there, users could either add and delete habbits, or view another tracker page that displays a grid of habbits performed in the past.<br/>\n                        <br/>\n                        We decided to use <a target=\"_blank\" className=\"orange\" href=\"https://firebase.google.com\"><b>Firebase</b></a> as our backend. The backend database would comprise of each user having a user ID, and each user ID having multiple children representing the habbits that the user has created. Every habbit would have information regarding when it was performed in the past and if it was performed today. <br/> \n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"proj-collection\">\n                        <img data-sr=\"enter bottom move 50px wait 0.2s\" className=\"proj-img20 proj-shadow\" src={wireframe}/>\n                        <img data-sr=\"enter bottom move 50px wait 0.25s\" className=\"proj-img20 proj-shadow\" src={backend}/>\n                    </div>\n                </Bounce>\n                <Bounce left delay={200}>\n                    <subtitle>\n                        Reflections\n                    </subtitle>\n                    <p className=\"writeup\">\n                        Creating Habbit was a challenging yet rewarding experience, especially for our first time making a mobile app. We spent a large amount of time deciding the entire structure before even coding anything since we did not want to waste any time backtracking. It also took some time to learn how certain APIs worked and if they would even contribute to our app.<br/>\n                        <br/>\n                        Through the making of Habbit, we gained a more thorough understanding of how a design concept translates into an actual product.
